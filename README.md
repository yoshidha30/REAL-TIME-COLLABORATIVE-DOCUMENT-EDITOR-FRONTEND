# TASK DESCRIPTION:

     The frontend of this project is built using React.js, a powerful and widely-used JavaScript library for building dynamic, high-performance user interfaces. Designed with a clean, intuitive layout, the frontend provides a real-time collaborative document editing experience that is both seamless and user-friendly.

At the core of the UI is a rich text editor powered by React-Quill, a flexible and lightweight WYSIWYG editor. This editor allows users to write, format, and structure content with ease, offering features like bold, italics, headings, bullet lists, and more – all through an interactive toolbar. The editor supports real-time syncing, ensuring that every change is instantly reflected across all users connected to the same document.

The frontend establishes a WebSocket connection using Socket.IO, allowing bi-directional communication between the client and server. This ensures instant transmission of edits, enabling a truly collaborative editing experience without the need to refresh the page or manually sync data.

In addition to editing, the UI includes a Dashboard that lists all existing documents. Users can create new documents with a single click, each assigned a unique ID for easy access. The dashboard is responsive and styled for clarity, making it easy for users to navigate between documents.

To improve usability, a Save button is integrated within the editor interface. Although real-time syncing already saves content automatically, the Save button provides an extra layer of control and reassurance for users who want to manually trigger a save operation.

The entire frontend is styled using clean, modern CSS to ensure readability and ease of use across devices. It follows best practices in component-based design, ensuring the UI is modular, maintainable, and scalable.

Overall, the frontend successfully delivers a responsive and interactive environment where multiple users can collaborate on documents in real time — fulfilling the requirements of a modern, dynamic web application.




# OUTPUT:
